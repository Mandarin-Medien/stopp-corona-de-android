/**
 * Helper class to keep [Scope] live when all attached lifecycle owners ([Fragment], [Activity]) are live.
 * Once the last lifecycle owner has destroyed, the scope is destroyed as well.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * If there are many lifecycle owners that needs to access to the one scope (i.e. some repository),
 * which is living only when lifecycle owners are live. Every lifecycle owner needs to call `connectToScope(scopeId)`
 * in his `onCreate` method. The scope is created automatically and is automatically closed
 * after all of lifecycle owners are destroyed.
 *
 * Second use case is to prevent accessing already created scope. Imagine a situation
 * you have a fragment A with list of items and fragment B which represent the detail of the item.
 * You open the detail from the list, go back and immediately open the detail fragment again.
 * Fragment B create a scope in his `onCreate` method. The problem could appear when there is
 * used fragment transition to change fragments (i.e. [FragmentTransaction.TRANSIT_FRAGMENT_FADE])
 * because the closing fragment B implicit calls `onDestroy` method AFTER the new fragment B
 * is created. It causes [ScopeAlreadyExistsException].
 * This class solves this situation, because fragment B which is using the one scope is registered
 * into a map and once the scope is used by the another instance of fragment B, the scope
 * is not recreating again. It is used already created scope. Than, the old fragment B is
 * destroyed and automatically removed from the map. In the map is only the new instance of fragment B.
 *
 * This class additionally solve the situation when the lifecycle owner ([Fragment], [Activity]) is in rotation and the scope
 * is recreating by default implementation of [Koin]. It this case this class prevent the scope
 * closing when detect some configuration changes before lifecycle owner is destroyed.
