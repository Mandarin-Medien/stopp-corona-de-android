# About
This Corona-Tracing-App is an Open-Source-Project to track and trace contacts. It is based on the model of the “Stopp Corona”-App by the Austrian Red Cross. This App has been adapted for use in Germany by digital marketing agency Mandarin Medien G.f.d.L mbh.

# Aim and function
This Corona-Tracing-App can contribute largely in the fight against the Covid-19 virus. It documents the digital handshake of two or more mobile phones. People who have come in contact with an infected person can be informed swiftly. Speedy exchange of information is essential when trying to break the Covid-19 transmission chain.
Using a virtual handshake the App registers all persons in the vicinity. The handshake has to be executed manually to register the contact on the device anonymously. Encrypted contact information is stored on the device for up to 72 hours.

# Reporting Corona infections
In case of a confirmed case of Corona the infected user can voluntarily and anonymously inform everybody they came into contact with during the last 72 hours. The encrypted IDs of the infected individual are then made available to all mobile phones running the Corona-Tracing-App. Subsequently the devices then check, if contact with the infected person has occured. The App then informs the user anonymously and they are able to self-isolate before becoming infectious.

# Your data is safe
The Corona-Tracing-App is completely voluntary. The App generates IDs for all contacts stored on the phone which are then encrypted and stored separately. Notifications are always processed anonymously.
